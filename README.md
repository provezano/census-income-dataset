# Census Income Dataset

Data analysis and income prediction based on the [Census Income Dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).</br></br>
The main idea here is to understand **what are the factors that lead someone to have high and a low monthly income**. </br>
In addition, **I developed a machine learning model to predict income** given some features.
